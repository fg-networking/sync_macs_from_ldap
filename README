Synchronization from LDAP to Extreme Access Control (sync_macs_from_ldap)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program "sync_macs_from_ldap" can be used to synchronize MAC
addresses and end-system group information stored in an LDAP server
with the data store of Extreme Access Control (EAC) (also known as
ExtremeControl, formerly known as NAC). It can be invoked via cron to
regularly synchronize from LDAP to the EAC data store.

Communication with both the LDAP server and the Extreme Management Center
(XMC) used to configure EAC uses IP connectivity. Thus sync_macs_from_ldap
can be executed on a system separate from both LDAP and EAC / XMC servers.

The program sync_macs_from_ldap can be installed on GNU/Linux
systems. Please See the INSTALL file for additional information.

The program sync_macs_from_ldap was developed to work with a Univention
Corporate Server (UCS) with end-system network information comprising
MAC addresses and logical network names. LDAP schema and TCP ports used
in sync_macs_from_ldap reflect the UCS setings.

Operation
---------

The script sync_macs_from_ldap reads MAC addresses, end-system group name,
and description from an LDAP server and adds / removes MAC addresses
from / to Extreme Management Center resp. Extreme Access Control
(formerly known as NAC).

Only MAC Addresses added via this script can be removed by this script.

The end-system groups need to be manually created in EMC / EAC, they are
not synched via this script.

Note that this script updates the EMC data base. Either a manual "enforce" or
the end-system group option "Automatically update Extreme Access Control
engines" is needed to propagate the changes to the EAC engines (NAC servers)

The LDAP server is queried using "ldapsearch."
EMC / EAC is accessed using Extreme Network's NAC Request Tool (NRT).
Output is sent to Syslog (additionally to STDERR if started with a TTY).

A lock file containing the running script's PID is used to prevent
parallel running instances. If this file persists although no instance
of sync_macs_from_ldap is running, it needs to be removed manually.
