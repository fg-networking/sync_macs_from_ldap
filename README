Synchronization from LDAP to Extreme Access Control (sync_macs_from_ldap)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program "sync_macs_from_ldap" can be used to synchronize MAC
addresses and end-system group information stored in an LDAP server
with the data store of Extreme Access Control (EAC) (also known as
ExtremeControl, formerly known as NAC). It can be invoked via cron to
regularly synchronize from LDAP to the EAC data store.

Communication with both the LDAP server and the Extreme Management Center
(XMC) used to configure EAC uses IP connectivity. Thus sync_macs_from_ldap
can be executed on a system separate from both LDAP and EAC / XMC servers.

The program sync_macs_from_ldap can be installed on GNU/Linux
systems. Please See the INSTALL file for additional information.

The program sync_macs_from_ldap was developed to work with a Univention
Corporate Server (UCS) with end-system network information comprising
MAC addresses and logical network names. LDAP schema and TCP ports used
in sync_macs_from_ldap reflect the UCS setings.
