Installing sync_macs_from_ldap
------------------------------

Installing "sync_macs_from_ldap" requires five steps:

1. Install respectively verify installation of required generic
   GNU/Linux prerequisites (the name in parenthesis is the name
   of the Debian resp. Ubuntu package name containing the programm):

  - Bash (bash)
  - diff (diffutils)
  - GNU Awk (gawk)
  - LDAP Search (ldap-utils)
  - logger (bsdutils)
  - sed (sed)
  - sort (coreutils)

2. Install the NAC Request Tool (NRT) available gratis from Extreme
   Networks. "sync_macs_from_ldap" expects NRT to be installed as:
   /usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NacRequestTool/NacRequest.sh

3. Copy the program "sync_macs_from_ldap" to /usr/local/bin/ with correct
   owner and access rights:

    install -m 750 -o root -g staff sync_macs_from_ldap /usr/local/bin/

4. Edit the installed "sync_macs_from_ldap" script section accoring to your
   needs (LDAP, XMC, and Syslog server settings). If NRT is not installed
   in the directory /usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NacRequestTool/ you need
   to adjust the script settings to your NRT installation.

5. Configure cron to regularly execute sync_macs_from_ldap. At least on
   Debian GNU/Linux and derived distributions like Ubuntu that can be
   done by copying the crontab fragment "syncmacs" to /etc/cron.d/ with
   correct owner and access rights:

    install -m 644 -o root -g staff syncmacs /etc/cron.d/
